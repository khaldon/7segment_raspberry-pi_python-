# 7segment_raspberry-pi_python-
there are 2 files 
1-test_segment.py
2-display_segment.py 
display_segment.py this library created and content it about the truth table of 7 segment 
# To run the code 
<h2>steps</h2>
1--make folder and put the 2 python file in same folder 
2- GPIO of raspberry pi with pins of 7segment i use  "GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)"

`A = 23`
`B = 19`
`C = 15`
`D = 11`
`E = 13`
`F = 5`
`G =3`

2-After defining the GPIO for pins 7segment run the test_segment.py to result

thank you
